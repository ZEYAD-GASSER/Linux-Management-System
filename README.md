# Linux Management System
This project is focused on managing and administering a Linux system using bash scripting.
It helped me gain practical knowledge of how the Linux file system works and how to handle various system administration tasks efficiently.
Through this project, I applied the skills learned in **Linux+** to automate several essential tasks

## 🛠 Features

- Simple login simulation.
- Add new users to the system.
- List all groups and their members.
- View system information and status.
- Backup user home directories.
- Search logs to track user actions.
- Organized into modular bash scripts.

## 📁 Structure

This project is made up of multiple Bash scripts. You can run each script individually depending on the task:

```bash
linux-management-project/
├── main.sh           # Main menu to access all tools
├── login.sh          # Simple login simulation
├── add_user.sh       # Add new users
├── search_logs.sh    # Search log files
├── system_info.sh    # Show system info
├── backup_home.sh    # Backup home directories
├── list_group.sh     # List users and groups
